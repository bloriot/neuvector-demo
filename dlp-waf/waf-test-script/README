Script in waf_test directory works on k8s cluster

1. Copy whole waf_test directory to your k8s cluster's master node

2. To set up WAF test environment from scratch run following inside your k8s cluster's master node

./setup_waf_test.sh

it creates following:
#httpd service backend
service/httpdtest-service created
deployment.apps/httpd-deployment created

#deploy WAF rules
nvwafsecurityrule.neuvector.com/sensor.traversal created
nvwafsecurityrule.neuvector.com/sensor.injection created
nvwafsecurityrule.neuvector.com/sensor.cross created
nvwafsecurityrule.neuvector.com/sensor.execution created
nvsecurityrule.neuvector.com/httpdtest-group created

#send attack traffic

===>TEST HyperSeek
===>TEST autohtml.php
